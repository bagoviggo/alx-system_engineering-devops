# 0x0B SSH

Welcome to the SSH (Secure Shell) project directory! In this section, you'll explore concepts related to secure remote access and management of systems using SSH.

## Background Context

In this project, you've been attributed an Ubuntu server, living in a distant datacenter. Unlike the previous level, you'll connect using SSH but not with a password; rather, you'll use an RSA key. The server has already been configured with the public key you created in the first task of a previous project, which is shared in your intranet profile.

You can access your server information in the "My Servers" section of the intranet. Each line contains the IP address and username to use for SSH connections.

**Note:** Your server is configured with an Ubuntu 20.04 LTS environment.
