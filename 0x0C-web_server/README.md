# 0x0C Web Server

Welcome to the Web Server project directory! In this section, you'll delve into the world of web servers and configuration. You'll learn how to set up, configure, and manage web servers to host websites and web applications.

## Background Context

This project emphasizes the automation of tasks through scripting and configuration. You'll learn to configure your web-01 server according to requirements and create Bash scripts that automate the setup process. Automating tasks allows you to streamline repetitive work and focus on more exciting challenges.

For instance, if you need to create a file `/tmp/test` containing the string "hello world" and modify the configuration of Nginx to listen on port 8080 instead of 80, you can use a Bash script to perform these tasks. This exercise aims to train you in automating manual tasks, a valuable skill for managing large numbers of servers.

Remember that the checker will execute your script as the root user, so you don't need to use the `sudo` command.

A good Software Engineer is a lazy Software Engineer.
