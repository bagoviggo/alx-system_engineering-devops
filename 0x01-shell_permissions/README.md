# 0x01-shell_permission

This project is a part of the ALX Software Engineering program, focusing on understanding and working with shell permissions in Linux.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this project, you should be able to explain the following concepts without relying on external resources:

- The purposes of the following commands: `chmod`, `sudo`, `su`, `chown`, and `chgrp`.
- Linux file permissions and how they are represented.
- Representing each set of permissions (owner, group, and other) as a single digit.
- Changing permissions, owner, and group of a file using relevant commands.
- Understanding why a normal user cannot change ownership of a file.
- Running a command with root privileges using `sudo`.
- Changing user ID or becoming a superuser using `su`.

## Resources

- [Permissions](https://www.guru99.com/file-permissions.html)
- `man` or `help` for:
  - `chmod`
  - `sudo`
  - `su`
  - `chown`
  - `chgrp`
  - `id`
  - `groups`
  - `whoami`
  - `adduser`
  - `useradd`
  - `addgroup`

## Other Man Pages

- How to create a user
- How to create a group
- How to print real and effective user and group IDs
- How to print the groups a user is in
- How to print the effective userid

## Requirements

### General

- Allowed editors: vi, vim, emacs
- All your scripts will be tested on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS
- All your scripts should be exactly two lines long (`$ wc -l file` should print 2)
- All your files should end with a new line
- The first line of all your files should be exactly `#!/bin/bash`
- A `README.md` file, at the root of the project folder, describing each script's purpose
- You are not allowed to use backticks, `&&`, `||`, or `;`
- All your files must be executable

## Project Structure

This project includes a series of Bash scripts, each addressing different aspects of shell permissions. Each script is expected to adhere to the specified requirements and learning objectives.

## Authorship and Plagiarism

- You are required to come up with solutions for the tasks yourself to meet the learning objectives.
- Plagiarism, including copying and pasting someone else's work, is strictly forbidden and will result in removal from the program.
- You are not allowed to publish any content of this project.

## Instructions for Scripts

Each script in this project is expected to be a concise two lines of Bash code, adhering to the principles of shell permissions and concepts learned in this project. Refer to the relevant man pages and resources when needed.

Please make sure to document each script's purpose in this `README.md` file.
